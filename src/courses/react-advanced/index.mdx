## Description

Once you know the basics of React, you are now ready to master the next level.
We cover all the arcane topics, including: architectural patterns of React,
custom hooks, render props, higher order components, performance optimization,
shared context, lazy loading, data immutability, Redux,
suspense loader, concurrent mode, NextJs, Remic, security and much more.

## Course Outline

---

### Context

- Property drilling
- Why use a context?
- Creating context using createContext()
- Using providers
- Consuming context with hooks
- Updating Context

### React Architecture Patterns

- Separation of concerns in Components
- Higher-Order Components
- Render props
- Custom hooks
- Reusing components

### Reducer pattern

- Replacing state with reducers
- Pillars: Storage, Dispatch, Reducer
- Action helpers
- Calling useReducer()

### Redux Toolkit

- Create a redux Store with configureStore()
- Generate reducers and actions with slices
- Write mutative code with "immer"
- Filter data with selectors

### Fetching Data with Redux RTK Query

- Create a redux Store with configure Store
- Generate reducers and actions with slices
- Write mutative code with "immer"
- Filter data with selectors

### Optimize React performance

- Using production build
- Avoiding re-renders
- Memoizing components with the memo() Higher Order Component
- useCallback() to make it work properly with memoized callbacks
- useMemo() that will memoize results instead of callbacks

### Error Boundaries and Suspense

- Managing Errors using ErrorBoundaries
- Using Suspense for Lazy Loading
- Using Suspense for Data Fetching

### Logins and Authentication

- Basic authentication in React
- Implementing a login form and a logout button
- Storing and managing user credentials
- Protecting routes and components
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Understanding and preventing common security vulnerabilities

### Comparing React Frameworks

- _Create-React-App_ for basic apps
- _Vite_ for quick development loops
- _Gatsby_ for Static Site Generation
- _Next.js_ for server-side rendering
- _Astro_ for server-side rendering without client-side JS.
- _Remix_ for data fetching and layout via routing
- _Preact_ for lightweight React

### Advanced UI

- Animating transitions using React-Spring
- Charts using Chart.js
- Adding maps using Leaflet and ESRI
