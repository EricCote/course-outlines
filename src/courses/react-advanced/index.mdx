## Description

Once you know the basics of React, you are now ready to master the next level.
We cover all the arcane topics, including: architectural patterns of React,
custom hooks, render props, higher order components, performance optimization,
shared context, lazy loading, reducer pattern, React Server Components, Suspense loader, Next.js,
Remix, security and much more.

We even use advanced components, like charts and maps.

## Course Outline

---

### Context

- Property drilling
- Why use a context?
- Creating context using createContext()
- Using providers
- Consuming context with hooks
- Updating Context

### Effects and useEffect()

- Sync external systems with Effects
- Make your component renders pure
- Cleanup functions
- Effects LifeCycle

### React Architecture Patterns

- Separation of concerns in Components
- Higher-Order Components
- Render Props
- Custom Hooks
- Reusing Components

### Reducer pattern

- Replacing state with reducers
- Pillars: Storage, Dispatch, Reducer
- Action helpers
- Calling useReducer()
- Write mutative code with "immer"

### TanStack Query

- Requests, deduplication, caching
- Data Fetch
- Data Updates
- Plugins

### Optimize React performance

- Using production build
- Avoiding re-renders
- Memoizing components with the memo() Higher Order Component
- useCallback() to make it work properly with memoized callbacks
- useMemo() to memoize results instead of callbacks

### Error Boundaries and Display management with Suspense

- Managing Errors using ErrorBoundaries
- Using Suspense for Lazy Loading
- Using Suspense for Data Fetching

### React Server Components (RSC)

- RSC Architecture
- Components: Server vs. Clients
- Client boundaries
- Client-Server separation
- Async data and Suspense

### React 19

- Forms and actions
- Transitions and animations
- Metadata
- Directives: "use client" and "use server"

### Advanced UI

- Animating transitions using React-Spring
- Charts using Chart.js
- Adding maps using Leaflet and ESRI

### Logins and Authentication
